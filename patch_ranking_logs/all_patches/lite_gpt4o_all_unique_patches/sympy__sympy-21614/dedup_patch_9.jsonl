Derivatives wrt defined functions (like\\n    cos(x)) are not allowed, either:\\n\\n        >>> (x*y*z).diff(x*y)\\n        Traceback (most recent call last):\\n        ...\\n        ValueError: Can't calculate derivative wrt x*y.\\n\\n    To make it easier to work with variational calculus, however,\\n    derivatives wrt AppliedUndef and Derivatives are allowed.\\n    For example, in the Euler-Lagrange method one may write\\n    F(t, u, v) where u = f(t) and v = f'(t). These variables can be\\n    written explicitly as functions of time::\\n\\n        >>> from sympy.abc import t\\n        >>> F = Function('F')\\n        >>> U = f(t)\\n        >>> V = U.diff(t)\\n\\n    The derivative wrt f(t) can be obtained directly:\\n\\n        >>> direct = F(t, U, V).diff(U)\\n\\n    When differentiation wrt a non-Symbol is attempted, the non-Symbol\\n    is temporarily converted to a Symbol while the differentiation\\n    is performed and the same answer is obtained:\\n\\n        >>> indirect = F(t, U, V).subs(U, x).diff(x).subs(x, U)\\n        >>> assert direct == indirect\\n\\n    The implication of this non-symbol replacement is that all\\n    functions are treated as independent of other functions and the\\n    symbols are independent of the functions that contain them::\\n\\n        >>> x.diff(f(x))\\n        0\\n        >>> g(x).diff(f(x))\\n        0\\n\\n    It also means that derivatives are assumed to depend only\\n    on the variables of differentiation, not on anything contained\\n    within the expression being differentiated::\\n\\n        >>> F = f(x)\\n        >>> Fx = F.diff(x)\\n        >>> Fx.diff(F)  # derivative depends on x, not F\\n        0\\n        >>> Fxx = Fx.diff(x)\\n        >>> Fxx.diff(Fx)  # derivative depends on x, not Fx\\n        0\\n\\n    The last example can be made explicit by showing the replacement\\n    of Fx in Fxx with y:\\n\\n        >>> Fxx.subs(Fx, y)\\n        Derivative(y, x)\\n\\n        Since that in itself will evaluate to zero, differentiating\\n        wrt Fx will also be zero:\\n\\n        >>> _.doit()\\n        0\\n\\n    Replacing undefined functions with concrete expressions\\n\\n    One must be careful to replace undefined functions with expressions\\n    that contain variables consistent with the function definition and\\n    the variables of differentiation or else insconsistent result will\\n    be obtained. Consider the following example:\\n\\n    >>> eq = f(x)*g(y)\\n    >>> eq.subs(f(x), x*y).diff(x, y).doit()\\n    y*Derivative(g(y), y) + g(y)\\n    >>> eq.diff(x, y).subs(f(x), x*y).doit()\\n    y*Derivative(g(y), y)\\n\\n    The results differ because `f(x)` was replaced with an expression\\n    that involved both variables of differentiation. In the abstract\\n    case, differentiation of `f(x)` by `y` is 0; in the concrete case,\\n    the presence of `y` made that derivative nonvanishing and produced\\n    the extra `g(y)` term.\\n\\n    Defining differentiation for an object\\n\\n    An object must define ._eval_derivative(symbol) method that returns\\n    the differentiation result. This function only needs to consider the\\n    non-trivial case where expr contains symbol and it should call the diff()\\n    method internally (not _eval_derivative); Derivative should be the only\\n    one to call _eval_derivative.\\n\\n    Any class can allow derivatives to be taken with respect to\\n    itself (while indicating its scalar nature).
